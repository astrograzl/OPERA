  - Added a Python harness for GRACES
  - Added 'flatresp' command to the Makefile harness to create flat response images from standard stars
  - Fixed Makefile harness putting duplicate calibration entries into opera.log during reductions (modules now output to operacal.log)
  - Refactored, made fixes to, cleaned up, and improved consistency of code across many modules
  - Updated many modules to use operaArgumentHandler library
  - Fixed potential memory leaks in several places
  - Made code more compliant with C++ standards, allowing OPERA to be built with stricter compilers or settings
  - Updated calibratedextendedbeamspectrum format (.spc files) to add two addtional columns: <normalizedFlux variance> <fcalFlux variance>
  - Updated extendedpolarimetry format (.pol files) to add two addtional columns: <normalized StokesI flux variance> <calibrated StokesI flux variance>
  - Fixed issue where flux errors would not correctly propagate to each Libre-Esprit intensity format
  - Fixed bug where intensity fits files had wrong number of columns in polar mode
  - Updated Makefile harness to use Heliocentric instead of Barycentric wavelength correction for polarimetry
  - Added a tilt plot for operaExtractionApertureCalibration and fixed related bugs (implemented in Python harness)
  - Fixed x-label of output plot in operaOrderSpacingCalibration
  - Updated the x-range of the SNR plot in Makefile.analysis
  - Fixed Python harness to match change made to parameters for operaTelluricCorrection
  - Updated Makefile harness to change instument profile calibration method
  - Added new argument to operaWavelengthCalibration --inputLineSetFilename, which allows to input a set of lines identified by hand instead of an initial solution (--wlcal_initialguess)
  - Added new argument to operaExtractionApertureCalibration --constantTilt to allow using a constant tilt angle for all orders
  - Added new argument to operaExtendedSpectrumCreation --SkyOverStarFiberAreaRatio to compensate for different apertures
  - Propagated changes for SkyOverStarFiberAreaRatio to the python harness (Makefile harness hasn't been updated for this)
  - Fixed a bug in operaWavelengthCalibration that would occur when using --parseSolution (not used by Espadons)
  - Modifications made to arguments for operaPolar and operaPolarimetryCorrection
  - Updated Makefile harness parameter values for operaWavelengthCalibration, operaGeometryCalibration, and operaExtractionApertureCalibration
  - Updated Python harness parameter values for operaOrderSpacingCalibration, operaGeometryCalibration, operaInstrumentProfileCalibration, operaExtractionApertureCalibration, and operaWavelengthCalibration
