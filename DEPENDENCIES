						     OPERA 1.0 EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES

You must build and install all these external libraries and tools before building opera.
Please DO NOT use macports, darwinports, or fink as they put stuff in odd places and will
cause you much pain later on. The libraries below are small and build and install from
source very easily with no further dependencies.

We strove to minimize the dependencies. There are only four. You MUST install these in 
the order shown and the installation MUST complete correctly. If a step fails, stop, and
call CFHT software group for help (808-885-7944). Ask for the software group and indicate
help with OPERA or send an email to teeple@cfht.hawaii.edu for help.

We have successfull installations on Linux Kernel 2.6.x.x, and MacOSX - Snow Leopard, 
Lion and Mountain Lion:

Snow Leopard	- 10.6
Lion			- 10.7
Mountin Lion	- 10.8

Older versions of MacOSX can be tricky because gcc of the appropriate version may be difficult
to locate. The command line tools were bundled at one point with XCode, and later were
unbundled and required a separate installation. If you have trouble locating the correct version
command line tools please send an email to teeple@cfht.hawaii.edu for help.

------------------------------- gotta have these -----------------------------------------

- gcc		-- compiles with version 3.x.x and up to 4.2.x of gcc, note that version 2.x.x 
			   has problems (no template suppport) and is not supported.
			-- first determine which version of gcc and g++ you have, do this in a terminal window:
				g++ -v
				gcc -v
			-- see MacOSX instructions below.

-------- don't go any further if you don't have the right version of gcc / g++ ----------

- cfitsio -- (mandatory) read and write FITS images				
			-- http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html
				Download the Linux version into your home directory and do the simplified steps
				(ignore all the warnings):
				cd cfitsio
				./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
				make
				sudo make install

- FFTW3   -- (mandatory)FFT Library
			-- download from http://www.fftw.org/
				Download the Linux version into your home directory and do the simplified steps:
				cd fftw-3.3
				./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
				make
				sudo make install

- lz		-- (mandatory) used to compress intermediate results
			-- download from http://www.zlib.net/
				cd zlib-<version>
				./configure
				make
				sudo make install
			   
------------------------------- you can stop here ------------------------------------------

- gnuplot 4.4 -- (recommended) used by some modules, but a test is made to see if gnuplot is installed,
	so operation will proceed without it (and without the plots)

- XCode	-- (recommended) FOR MAC USERS ONLY 
			- used to browse the opera-1.0 project on a mac and also
			   to get a gcc compiler to build the above libraries...
			- BUT you do need the command line tools!
			- http://developer.apple.com
				- you must register as a mac developer
				- go to the xcode download page
				- download Code and install it
				- download the command line tools extras and install it (includes gcc or llvm-gcc)

- fitsverify -- (recommended) used to check the validity of FITS output files
			-- http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools/fitsverify/
		- use the simplified command:
		gcc -o fitsverify ftverify.c fvrf_data.c fvrf_file.c fvrf_head.c fvrf_key.c fvrf_misc.c -DSTANDALONE -L. -lcfitsio


------------------------------- other stuff don't bother ---------------------------------------

- WCSlib -- (if you need it) best to get it and build it as a standalone library and then include in 
			lib/ then:
		configure --enable-LIBWCS=true --prefix=$HOME/opera-1.0
		
		- http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/wcslib/
		- ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/software/wcslib/wcslib-4.17.tar.bz2

------------------------------- you should probably stop here -----------------------------------------

- libPNG  -- (optional) used by the tool operaFITStoPNG and some visualization tools
			-- you would configure thusly:
			   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opera-1.0/ --enable-LIBPNG=true
			-- http://www.libpng.org
				cd libpng-<version>
				./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
				make
				sudo make install
				
- libfreetype -- (optional) used by the visualization tools to label graphs
			-- http://www.freetype.org/

--------------------------------------- forget it ------------------------------------------------------
			
- doxygen	-- (optional) used if you need to regenerate documentation
			-- http://www.doxygen.org
			
- graphviz	-- (optional) used by doxygen if the doc/Doxyfile has HAVE_DOT = YES,
				meaning that you want to generate callgraphs in the documentation.
			-- http://www.graphviz.org

- JPL		-- (optional) Solar System Ephemeris 
			-- http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/ephem_descr.html
