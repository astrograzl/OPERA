  - Added wavelength calibration parameters for DetectionThreshold and MinPeakDepth (operaWavelengthCalibration)
  - Fixed issue where harness was using the wrong parameter names for plots in operaPolarimetryCorrection
  - Fixed issue where harness was not passsing .rvel or .tell files to operaCreateProduct for all modes
  - Fixed harness to say "Heliocentric" instead of "Barycentric"
  - Fixed various order numbering problems caused by LE_order_wavelength.dat and wcal_ref.dat.gz files, as well as referenceOrderNumber and stitch_orderOfReference parameters
  - Updated more modules to use operaArgumentHandler (operaBias, operaCalculateSpectraclResolution)
  - Updated the way telluric wavelength corrections are applied so the .tell file contains a radial velocity shift instead of wavelength calibration coefficients (operaTelluricWavelengthCorrection, operaSpectralOrder, operaSpectralOrderVector, operaPolarIntensity, operaPolarimetryCorrection, operaStarOnly, operaStarPlusSky)
  - Updated FITS output file to contain header keyword "TELLRV" (operaCreateProduct)
  - Updated FITS output file to no longer contain comments with redundant column descriptions (operaCreateProduct)
  - Updated telluric region mask (wavelengthMaskForTelluricAbsorption.txt)
  - Updated harness to be able to use LE order wavelength ranges for generating LE polarimetry products
  - Updated harness parameters in geometry calibration, instrumpent profile calibration, and polarimetry extraction
  - Updated harness to set x/y-ranges for plots of LE products
  - Updated GRACES harness with modifications similiar to the ones made for ESPaDOnS
