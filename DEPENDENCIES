						     OPERA 1.0 EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES

You must build and install all these external libraries and tools before building OPERA.
Please DO NOT use macports, darwinports, or fink as they put things in odd places and will
cause you much pain later on. The libraries below are small and build and install from
source very easily with no further dependencies.

We strove to minimize the dependencies. There are only four. You MUST install these in 
the order shown and the installation MUST complete correctly. If a step fails, stop, and
call CFHT software group for help (808-885-7944). Ask for the software group and indicate
help with OPERA or send an email to opera@cfht.hawaii.edu for help.

We have successfull installations on Linux Kernel 2.6.x.x, and MacOSX 10.6 to 10.10:

Snow Leopard	- 10.6
Lion			- 10.7
Mountin Lion	- 10.8
Mavericks		- 10.9
Yosemite		- 10.10

Older versions of MacOSX can be tricky because gcc of the appropriate version may be difficult
to locate. The command line tools were bundled at one point with XCode, and later were
unbundled and required a separate installation. If you have trouble locating the correct version
command line tools please send an email to opera@cfht.hawaii.edu for help.

---------------------------------------- REQUIRED ----------------------------------------

1.) GCC		-- MacOSX users: see Xcode instructions below.
			-- Opera compiles with GCC versions 3.x.x and newer.
			-- Version 2.x does not work with templates, and is not supported.
			-- Latest version successfully tested on was 4.8.2.
			-- To determine which version of gcc and g++ you have, in a terminal window:
				g++ -v
				gcc -v

Don't go any further if you don't have the right version of gcc/g++.

2.) CFITSIO	-- Reads and write FITS images
			-- Homepage: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html
			-- Installation instructions:
				Download: ftp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/fitsio/c/cfitsio_latest.tar.gz
				Extract to your home folder.
				Run the following commands in the terminal (ignore the warnings):
					cd cfitsio
					./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
					make
					sudo make install
					cd ..

3.) FFTW3   -- Fast Fourier transform library
			-- Homepage: http://www.fftw.org/
			-- Installation instructions:
				Download: http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.3.4.tar.gz
				Extract to your home folder.
				Run the following commands in the terminal:
					cd fftw-3.3.4
					./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
					make
					sudo make install
					cd ..

4.) zlib	-- Used to compress intermediate results
			-- Homepage: http://zlib.net/
			-- Instructions to download and install from terminal:
				Download: http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
				Extract to your home folder.
				Run the following commands in the terminal:
					cd zlib-1.2.8
					./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
					make
					sudo make install
					cd ..
			   
--------------------------------------- RECOMMENDED --------------------------------------

- Xcode		-- FOR MAC USERS ONLY 
			-- You can install Xcode most easily through the App Store.
			-- Includes gcc (or llvm-gcc), and can be used to browse the OPERA project.
			-- The Command Line Tools package may need to be installed from Xcode as well:
				Preferences -> Downloads -> Command Line Tools
			-- Alternatively, you can install the Command Line Tools without Xcode:
				Go to the Apple developer site: http://developer.apple.com
				Register as a developer.
				Download and install the Xcode Command Line Tools.

- gnuplot	-- Used by some of the modules to generate plots.
			-- Homepage: http://www.gnuplot.info/
			-- If gnuplot is not installed, operation will proceed without the plots.
			-- Works with with version 4.4 and up. Last tested with gnulot 5.0.
				Download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/5.0.0/gnuplot-5.0.0.tar.gz/download
				Can be built using configure, make, make install as the required libraries were.

---------------------------------------- OPTIONAL ----------------------------------------

- fitsverify -- Used to check the validity of FITS output files
			-- Homepage: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools/fitsverify/
			-- To build, use the simplified command:
				gcc -o fitsverify ftverify.c fvrf_data.c fvrf_file.c fvrf_head.c fvrf_key.c fvrf_misc.c -DSTANDALONE -L. -lcfitsio

- WCSlib 	-- FITS World Coordinate System describes astronomical coordinate systems in a FITS image header
			-- Homepage: http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/wcslib/
			-- Download: ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/software/wcslib/wcslib-4.17.tar.bz2
			-- If you need it, best to build it as a standalone library and then include in lib. When building OPERA:
				configure --enable-LIBWCS=true --prefix=$HOME/opera-1.0		

----------------------------------- EVEN MORE OPTIONAL -----------------------------------

- libPNG	-- Used by the tool operaFITStoPNG and some visualization tools.
			-- You would configure thusly:
			   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opera-1.0/ --enable-LIBPNG=true
			-- http://www.libpng.org
				cd libpng-<version>
				./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
				make
				sudo make install
				
- libfreetype -- Used by the visualization tools to label graphs.
			-- http://www.freetype.org/

---------------------------------- YOU WON'T NEED THESE ----------------------------------
			
- doxygen	-- Used if you need to regenerate documentation.
			-- http://www.doxygen.org
			
- graphviz	-- Used by doxygen to generate callgraphs in the documentation.
			-- To enable, in doc/Doxyfile, put: HAVE_DOT = YES
			-- http://www.graphviz.org

- JPL		-- Solar System Ephemeris
			-- http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~rfisher/Ephemerides/ephem_descr.html
