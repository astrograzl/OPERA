- changed "break" to "continue" so further orders are processed in:
	void operaSpectralOrder::measureContinuum(operaFluxVector &uncalibratedFlux,operaFluxVector &outputContinuum, operaSpectralEnergyDistribution &spectralEnergyDistribution, unsigned binsize, unsigned nsigcut, unsigned orderOfPolynomial, bool usePolynomial) {
- fixed bugs in operaReductionSet
