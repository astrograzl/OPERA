 Libraries:
  - Rewrote library function operaArrayIndexSort, fixing a bug which caused data to be incorrectly sorted.
  - Fixed a bug in operaSpectralTools library function calculateUniformSample where the last point was sometimes left uninitialized.
  - Modified operaSpectralOrder function calculateStarAndSkyElements to actually perform sky subtraction.
  - Rewrote much of the operaFluxVector class to work in a more understandable way and fix issues with several calculations.
  - Added Resize methods to operaFluxVector, operaSpectralElements, operaStokesVector and operaPolarimetry. Used these in place of previous resizing functionality which had unpredictable behavior.
  - Added several core pieces of functionality, refactored code, and fixed many issues involving extended flux vectors, especially for individual beams.
  - Updated many methods in various classes, along with some other library functions, to improve const correctness.
  - Split normalizeAndApplyFlatResponseINTOExtendendSpectra into two independent methods. Rewrote and refactored both, and many of the methods they call, allowing them to work on each beam.
  - Refactored, reorganized, cleaned up, and fixed bugs in file reading/writing functions in operaSpectralOrderVector and moved them into new operaIOFormats library, which should be more consistent and easier to maintain.
  - Refactored functionality for reading in wavelength ranges, and trimming orders by wavelength ranges into operaSpectralOrder and operaSpectralOrderVector, and fixed several issues with data being scrambled.
  - Increased MAXORDERS from 100 to 200 (was preventing data reduction for a different spectograph).
 Modules:
  - Rewrote operaStitchOrders to use radial velocity shifts instead of wavelength shifts. Changed arguments accordingly, and added a diagnostic plot.
  - Rewrote operaTelluricWavelengthCorrection to improve clarity and fix issues. Implemented new correction method using telluric line matching, giving improved results. Implemented addtional plots.
  - Rewrote operaCreateProduct to only convert from LE or spc/pol files. Added ability to trim orders. Determines mode from spectrumtype argument instead of checking fits keyword. Removed work-in-progress info from headers.
  - Modified operaWavelengthCalibration to skip the last solution refinement step. Added missing output statements. Changed non-error messages to write to stdout instead of stderr. Added more information to data/plot files.
  - Updated operaExtendedSpectrumCreation to add ability to read in wavelength ranges and trim orders, allowing the removal of noisy regions before normalization.
  - Refactored and cleaned up operaCentricWavelengthCorrection. Updated to use the time halfway through the exposure rather than at the end. Fixed an issue where negative signs were lost if the hours/degrees equaled zero.
  - Fixed several bugs and cleaned up code in operaGain. Updated to perform more stringent checks on its arguments.
  - Updated operaInstrumentProfile to handle errors more gracefully when they should be non-fatal.
  - Updated operaPixelSensitivityMap to use operaArgumentHandler.
  - Cleaned up code in operaPolar, operaSNR, operaCalculateSpectralResolution, and operaPixelSensitivityMap.
  - Made more arguments required in several modules.
  - Commented out section of currently unused operaStatistics tool that required deprecated functions.
 Formats:
  - Corrected naming convention for Libre-Esprit files so that "w" (e.g. inw and iuw) means "without telluric wavelength correction."
  - Replaced SNR format with a new format that includes both SNR per spectral bin and SNR per CCD pixel.
  - Replaced old m.fits product with new format containing the same columns as the spc file.
  - Changed decimal precision of distance in .p file to match precision in .e file.
  - Added fcal/normalized flux/variance for each beam to spc format, and reorganized and relabeled columns for consistency.
 Config:
  - Modifed wavelength ranges in LE_order_wavelength.dat, and changed format to allow file to be read in by operaIOFormats.
  - Updated wavelengthMaskForTelluricAbsorption.txt to remove very red region.
  - Added GRACES flat response (obtained from commissioning data of Feige66 observed on Jun 03/04 2015).
 Harness:
  - Updated harness to trim orders to LE order wl ranges only during spc and pol creation.
  - Skipping operaStitchOrders for now, since results seem better without it.
  - Updated the way harness calculates exposure time for operaHeliocentricWavelengthCorrection for polarimetry.
  - Fixed call to operaCreateProduct to use p.rvel and p.tell instead of i.rvel and i.tell when creating p.fits.
  - Added arguments or fixed argument issues with operaStarPlusSky, operaExtractionApertureCalibration, operaTelluricWavelengthCorrection, and operaGain.
  - Removed plot arguments from operaExtraction.
  - Added error checks for missing rvel/tell files when they are expected.
  - Reduced telluric radial velocity range and step size.
  - Changed wavelength calibration damping factor for polar and S+S observing mode to have more Th-Ar lines.
  - Updated operagetmode to take optional argument specifying the mode header keyword, and updated harness to use MODE_HEADERKEY parameter for determining the instrument mode.
  - Updated Makefile.calibration for GRACES modifications for masterflat, masterbias, mastercomparison, images.
  - Fixed a few bugs in GRACES Python harness and tuned parameters to make reduction more robust. Added simple command line tool to add object keyword to FITS file.
  - Added harness directory for Narval.
 Other:
  - Fixed issue with linker options which would cause build to fail on some platforms.
  - Moved unused modules and parts of the harness to extras directory.
